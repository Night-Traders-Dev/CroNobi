# Virtual Operating System (vOS)

The Virtual Operating System (vOS) is a simplified, virtualized operating system designed to provide a learning platform for understanding the basics of file systems, command execution, and kernel operations. vOS seamlessly integrates with the QSE Blockchain, enhancing its capabilities and providing users with a comprehensive development environment. This README provides an overview of the key components of vOS and its integration with the QSE Blockchain.

## Components

### 1. VirtualFS

VirtualFS is responsible for managing the file system within vOS. It provides functionalities to create, read, write, rename, and delete files and directories. The file system structure is represented using Python classes, including `File` and `Directory`. VirtualFS ensures the integrity and accessibility of files and directories.

### 2. VirtualKernel

VirtualKernel serves as the core component of vOS, responsible for managing system-wide operations and logging. It provides a centralized interface for executing commands, logging system events, and handling errors. VirtualKernel ensures the coordination and synchronization of activities within vOS.

### 3. VirtualMachine

VirtualMachine simulates the execution environment for vOS, providing a sandboxed platform for running commands and interacting with the file system. It emulates the behavior of a real operating system, allowing users to experience the functionalities of vOS in a controlled environment.

### 4. VirtualAPI

VirtualAPI facilitates the integration of external modules and functionalities into vOS. It serves as an interface for accessing additional features and services, allowing developers to extend the capabilities of vOS through modular components.

## Integration with QSE Blockchain

vOS integrates seamlessly with the QSE Blockchain, offering developers a powerful environment to build, test, and deploy blockchain applications. By leveraging vOS's file system management and command execution capabilities, developers can easily interact with smart contracts, manage cryptographic keys, and deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on the QSE Blockchain.

## Usage

To use vOS with the QSE Blockchain integration:

1. Install Python, along with the required modules `Rich` and `Textual`.
2. Clone the vOS repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the vOS and src directory and execute the `virtualos.py` script.
4. Use the provided shell commands from the `vbin/` directory to interact with the virtual file system and execute operations.
5. Utilize the QSE Blockchain integration for developing, testing, and deploying blockchain applications within vOS.
