# Virtual Operating System (vOS)

The Virtual Operating System (vOS) is a simplified, virtualized operating system designed to provide a learning platform for understanding the basics of file systems, command execution, and kernel operations. vOS seamlessly integrates with the QSE Blockchain, enhancing its capabilities and providing users with a comprehensive development environment. This README provides an overview of the key components of vOS and its integration with the QSE Blockchain.

## Components

### 1. VirtualFS

VirtualFS is responsible for managing the file system within vOS. It provides functionalities to create, read, write, rename, and delete files and directories. The file system structure is represented using Python classes, including `File` and `Directory`. VirtualFS ensures the integrity and accessibility of files and directories.

### 2. VCommands

VCommands module contains implementations of various shell commands that users can execute within vOS. These commands include `mkdir` for creating directories, `ls` for listing directory contents, `cd` for changing the current directory, `cat` for displaying file contents, `touch` for creating files, and many more. These commands interact with the VirtualFS module to perform file system operations.

### 3. VirtualKernel

VirtualKernel serves as the core component of vOS, responsible for managing system-wide operations and logging. It provides a centralized interface for executing commands, logging system events, and handling errors. VirtualKernel ensures the coordination and synchronization of activities within vOS.

### 4. VirtualMachine

VirtualMachine simulates the execution environment for vOS, providing a sandboxed platform for running commands and interacting with the file system. It emulates the behavior of a real operating system, allowing users to experience the functionalities of vOS in a controlled environment.

## Integration with QSE Blockchain

vOS integrates seamlessly with the QSE Blockchain, offering developers a powerful environment to build, test, and deploy blockchain applications. By leveraging vOS's file system management and command execution capabilities, developers can easily interact with smart contracts, manage cryptographic keys, and deploy decentralized applications (DApps) on the QSE Blockchain.

## Usage

To use vOS with the QSE Blockchain integration, follow these steps:

1. Install Python on your system if not already installed.
2. Install the required Python modules `Rich` and `Keyboard`.
3. Clone the vOS repository to your local machine.
4. Navigate to the vOS directory and execute the `virtualos.py` script.
5. Use the provided shell commands to interact with the virtual file system and execute operations.
6. Utilize the QSE Blockchain integration to develop, test, and deploy blockchain applications seamlessly within vOS.
